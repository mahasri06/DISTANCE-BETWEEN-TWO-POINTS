# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2: 
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)

### Step 4: 
using the print function, display the distance between the two points.
### Step 5: 
End the program.

### PROGRAM:
```
DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS
Developed by:Mahasri P
register no. : 212223100029

point1 = [4, 2]
point2 = [10, 6]

x_diff = point2[0] - point1[0]
y_diff = point2[1] - point1[1]

distance = round(((x_diff**2) + (y_diff**2))**0.5, 2)

print(distance)
```


### OUTPUT:
